[General]

Who are you ? 

I'm Frey üêâ## year old Software developer I used to work with Linux/UNIX system since I was in my middle school I install Linux accidentally and then whole this journey started.

You are from ? 

well people usually asked this question (like almost everyone and I don't know why ? maybe it's because of human nature ?) well I'm from inda or I better say Im living in india :) right now.



When you joined telegram and how ? 

I joined this awesome application in the end of 2019 

I don't remember exactly how I end up here but it must be some random article I was reading on internet [something on users privacy]



Why are you using telegram ? 

Well after when and how I joined telegram I think this will be the next question in mind I started to use telegram because of its API and bot making modules 

when I joined telegram I was in almost every developer communities including programming help / support groups I was amazed how people used to help each other, mostly in support groups.



What you do except programming ? 

well this one is interesting question as I have quite a bit intresting hobbies and one of the best is Editing photos and making logos I love to make logos and edit pics in past I used to write blogs :) now when I read them I only laugh on those :)



what you are doing right now ? 

I'm doing my CSE (computer science engineering)

but except that I read a lot about Cybersecurity well that's compulsory for because because of my CTF team.



Have you did or made some noble ? 

No sir/mam I didn't do anything Nobel or anything specific yet but I'm trying hard to do something for humanity for better future :) that's what my present self can do right now. and I don't want to be a rockstar as you can easily see users (people) here on telegram thinking they are rock star's mostly in Dev Communities like pro and noobs 

please don't be like that :)
